This website is the canonical source of schema definitions for tools
developed and maintained by Sierra Softworks. These schemas are primarily
intended to assist developers in modifying things like configuration files
within supported editors.

## Recommended Editors
 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is an excellent code editor
   which includes first-class support for [JSONSchema][]. If you are modifying JSON
   files for which we have published schema definitions, it will provide you with inline
   suggestions and warnings.
